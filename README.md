# Credit Card Workout
Porticode 2.0 2017 Project submission

## About
Website that takes a users credit card balance, interest rate and monthly amount they wish to pay to calculate how long it would take them to pay their debit off as well as showing them how much interest they have accumulated. This was made within 24 hours for the Porticode 2.0 Hackathon in October 2017.
